## Project Brief

### Proposal

## Trello Board
---

I used a kanban board on Trello to manage my workflow during the project, the board was set to public to enable overview and broadcast. Agile methodology was implemented in line with the brief, in terms of product and sprint backlog, although due to the individual nature of the project, no scrum working practices were implemented. The board was set up with reference to potential user stories emphasising the CRUD functionality of the database system. Although unrequired, a Task Backlog was instituted in order to keep the requirements of the project spec clear, so as to enable sprint tasks to be dynamically allocated to them.

Due to this setup sprints could be passed through development, and, if required, testing, before being assigned to Done. Once sprints generated by a backlogged Task have been completed, the task itself can be marked Done. Errors, mistakes, and software bugs are given over to the newly added Bugs column, to be fed back to development and testing when identified and processed.

### Start Point

![A picture of the trello board, started on the first week. The Product Backlog, The Sprint Backlog, the Tasks for the first week have been added. Only the 'Start the Trello board' task has been completed](https://i.imgur.com/op4ChN4.png)

At the start of the project, I focussed on the four tasks most easily completable in the first week of training: Starting the Kanban board [itself](https://trello.com/b/8xaM1s0K/qa-week-5-individual-project-hotsaucerecipe), starting this documentation to streamline my future workflow, instituting a github repository for the project, which can be found [here](https://github.com/THC-QA/QA_SFIA_Project), and initialising the risk assessment for the project in line with my initial understanding.

### Rolling Changes

+ The first major change to the Kanban board was a respec to denote the removing of Selenium testing from the project, due to the lack of javascript implementation. In replacement, a provisional addition of Postman testing was added, so as to validate the REST API, and therefore CRUD functionality of our APIs. In addition, issues with reimaging hardware lead to the need to implement Visual Code Studio usage. To this end I installed the Remote SSH, mySQL, Python, and Code Spellchecker extensions, so as to improve project flow. Notepad++ is being explored in replacement of VIM for GitBASH. The database has been implemented as a simple relationship between two main tables, the user table has been omitted until hashing of passwords and pre-encryption can be handled on the app side.

+ An ERD was started on LucidChart, and a mockup of the database instituted on a GCP MySQL server. Should be noted due to the particular relationship between recipes and ingredients that it would be more efficient to use a noSQL database, albeit outside the project scope. The risk assessment was started, and will be added to as the project continues. Whilst this entire system could be run in the GitHub projects utility, this is again outside the scope of the brief. A GCP Compute instance is running Ubuntu is being used for the pythonic programming, and has been updated with the relevant modules, including Flask. Visual Studio Code is used for access.

+ The ERD was edited into its final version, and will be coloured appropriately to reflect the state of project at completion. A mySQL file has been created in order to institute the framework of the database to fulfil the MVP of the project brief. A further mySQL file acts as a secondary backup to populate the tables with example data to showcase the website.

+ A barebones CRUD functional website has been created in python, HTML, and CSS. It uses the Flask module with Jinja2, mysqlDB, and WTForms. Issues have been encountered involving WTForms implementation. Several of the user stories have been completed, but the others are on hold until the usefulness of a user system is decided on. A Requirements file has been added to the Flask app, currently hosted on a different repository pending Jenkins integration.

+ Website updated to full compliance with brief. User stories revised to reflect updated understanding of technical complexities. Favicon added as joke branding. Jenkinsfile added, and installation and pre-installation processing started. Problems involving exported environmental variables.

+ Jenkins pipeline updated to include URL testing phase. ChilliApp now runs as a service, GUnicorn integration problematic, but can replace debug mode on deployment. In contravention of usual working practice, Jenkins server exposed to web traffic in place of a reverse proxy, as ngrok or nginx integration is an issue.

+ Having looked hard at the feasibility of utilising Postman as an ancilliary service to the project, I elected to use Selenium after all. The time requirements for learning to use the program and creating a mockup could be better spent learning to use HTML id tags properly.

## Project Architecture
---

### Entity Relationships

![The entity relationship diagram for the project, comprising the recipe, ingredients, and recipe_ingredients tables, and the unimplemented user table](https://i.imgur.com/XbLKyPc.png)

The core of the project comprises three linked tables, two main and one joining, in a mySQL database. The joining table links data from recipe and ingredients tables to show which ingredients are used in the methods for particular recipes. This architecture reduces the load that would be required for multiple empty fields for recipes as different recipes have different numbers of ingredients used for them.

Ancilliary to this are the user and admin tables, which aren't required to be instituted for project completion. This being said, they represent two different use cases for site approach. In terms of security and database management, they would have different permission roles and security provisions vis a vis the database itself, and most aspects of site architecture. As marks for this project are weighted toward backend technologies, as of project handoff, they have not been implemented.

To represent these options more clearly, I have included a use case diagram.

### Overall Architecture

![The architecture diagram for the project, showing an overview of the languages and toolsets used to build, control, test, and deploy.](https://i.imgur.com/5quYapC.png)

The project, known currently as ChilliApp, was built on a framework of python, with the use of the module Flask, and its extensions mysql_db and WTForms. The website displays using the Bootstrap API, with custom HTML and CSS stylings making use of Jinja2. Fully CRUD functional, it links to a mySQL server hosted on a GCP instance.

Version controlled by way of GitHub, the project uses a WebHook to toggle Jenkins pipeline builds. This CI/CD server can be obfuscated by way of ngrok to prevent port exposure, but this was not kept for the project handover, as the free version hangs the terminal.

The pipeline itself is coded in Groovy, making heavy use of BASH scripts to enable environment setup on the same GCP compute instance as the Jenkins server for testing.

Testing itself is achieved using PyTest and the Selenium plugin for flask, discussed later.

The finished build, if tests are passed, is deployed onto a worker node, where it launches using GUnicorn, at 6 nodes, to achieve poll stable load balancing.

### Issues Encountered

+ Swapped out SQLAlchemy for mysql_db.

+ Serious difficulties getting WTForms to take dynamic fields.

+ Used NGROK for port tunnelling until finding limitations of free version.

+ Ran into a lot of user permissions errors with Jenkins, studied the documentation

+ Ran into polling issues with GUnicorn

## Design Considerations

### Front End

Front end issues were not a focus for this project.

That being said, the bootstrap template was overridden in places with custom CSS stylings, and Jinja2 was used to inherit styling from the master layout template, and handle python form data objects for display.

### Back End

Agile principles of functional code over documentation and prioritisation of working builds lead to a pursuit of lowest path of resistance design.

App routes and functions in the project are prioritised to be multi function, using the variance of polled form data to determine data endpoints. An example programmatic flow chart is included for reference.

![Flow chart demonstrating process flow for the mvp page POST request handling stream](https://i.imgur.com/fHCiX9z.png)

Code representation:

```if request.method == "POST":
        details = request.form
        if "new_name" in details:
            recipe_name = details["recipe_name"]
            new_name = details["new_name"]
            cur = mysql.connection.cursor()
            cur.execute("UPDATE recipes SET recipe_name = (%s) WHERE recipe_name = (%s);", (new_name, recipe_name))
        elif "ingredient_name" in details:
            ingredient_name = details["ingredient_name"]
            cur = mysql.connection.cursor()
            cur.execute("SELECT id FROM ingredients WHERE ingredient_name = (%s)", [ingredient_name])
            ingredient_id = cur.fetchall()
            mysql.connection.commit()
            cur.execute("DELETE IGNORE FROM recipe_ingredients WHERE ingredient_id = (%s);", [ingredient_id])
            mysql.connection.commit()
            cur.execute("DELETE FROM ingredients WHERE ingredient_name = (%s);", [ingredient_name])
        else:
            recipe_name = details["recipe_name"]
            cur = mysql.connection.cursor()
            cur.execute("SELECT id FROM recipes WHERE recipe_name = (%s)", [recipe_name])
            recipe_id = cur.fetchall()
            mysql.connection.commit()
            cur.execute("DELETE IGNORE FROM recipe_ingredients WHERE recipe_id = (%s);", [recipe_id])
            mysql.connection.commit()
            cur.execute("DELETE FROM recipes WHERE recipe_name = (%s);", [recipe_name])
        mysql.connection.commit()
        cur.close()
        return redirect("/browse")
```

A mix of WTForms and HTML form POST handling was used to avoid substantial issues with Dynamic Form handling in mysql_db integration.

To prevent SQL conflicts, the mySQL instance data structure was chosen quite carefully. Examples of this would be the paired usage of IGNORE statements and UNIQUE keywords, to prevent col return errors.

Display of the database on the /browse page required careful understanding of the return structure of read data. A three table join was used to ensure that ingredients were linked to their correct recipes, and a nested set of for loops enables their handling and restructuring for Jinja display.

### UI

Beyond native bootstrap stylings, UI considerations were not at the forefront. Submissions boxes are selected to allow clear display and entry of data. Although the website itself is suited to wide aspect display and updated browsers, it still displays on phone browsers with minimal errors.

For the favicon, and placeholder branding design, a logo was created.

## Testing

### Pytest

There are two main branches within the Pytest testing stream; url_testing, and db_testing.

Each of these are reflected in a separate stage within the Jenkinsfile pipeline instructions.

+ **url_testing**

The URL testing block pings each of the web pages in turn after a build to ensure that the site is up and callable, then verifies the results by pinging an absent 'negative' page.

7 tests are run.

1 for each page.

1 for an empty call.

Due to the complexity of called modules, coverage hovers around 46%.

+ **db_testing**

The database testing block spins a mirrored set of the mySQL tables in a separate database 'testing' on the instance. The database is wiped, and then each aspect of CRUD functionality is tested, mirroring the SQL structure of the flask functions.

17 tests are run.

The database is wiped.

Each table is CREATED, then checked for structure.

Each table is INSERTED into, then the UNIQUE keyword is tested.

Each table has a database entry UPDATED.

The FOREIGN KEY constraints are tested, before all entries are clean deleted.

Coverage averages 38%.

### Selenium

Selenium testing pending HTML [id] assignment.

### Final Report

Testing log stored on Jenkins server. Problems were encountered attempting to get the server to return testing documents to GitHub. It would be necessary to store GitHub login files as environmental variables on the server, which will be avoided for the project build. Currently the server is vulnerable to port mapping and injection, so account details will not be stored.

## Deployment

### Toolset

As of 2020/03/19.

+ GCP Instance development environment

+ GitHub Webhook

+ Jenkins Server

+ Pipeline build coded in Groovy and Shell.

+ Testing in Pytest using the Coverage module.

+ 2 build run using debug mode and a GUnicorn 6 node mirror.

+ Final build deployment onto separate instance (currently inactive due to cost).

### CI Server Implementation

A jenkins server runs pipeline builds of the project, automating the testing functions, before deploying the website.

## Front End Considerations

Taking industry standards into consideration, the lack of a single native page webApp, and the lack of coherent use of Javascript, and JQuery means there is substantial room for improvement in the front end of the website. Limited time meant that the usage of Bootstrap was clumsy at best, even as a shortcut.

Site functionality itself could be improved, particularly in regards to a search function, and full coverage for user accounts and Admin/Moderator privileges.

Documentation was severely lacking for WTForms, Coverage, and other modules, as they are presupposing very specific setups and project architecture. Whilst the usage of mysql_db over SQLAlchemy was far more intuitive, and makes better use of non-native mySQL servers, its support and documentation is minimal, and Alchemy seems to be the more popular option.

The industry is increasingly moving to coherent, single window, modular webApps, and for an enterprise project, it would be necessary to follow the skills sets for the industry. Some more distributed formats suit the code structure of a python back end relation, a noteable example being Reddit.

For future considerations, particularly regarding the usage of python as a web development language, [Aaron Swartz's views](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/rewritingreddit) on migrating large services, and the lack of decent API development, it will be necessary to keep a tight eye on the open source community, and its reactions to industry demands.

## Improvements for Future Versions

In addition to front end considerations, an enterprise version of the app would require a change in the deployment and testing cycle.
